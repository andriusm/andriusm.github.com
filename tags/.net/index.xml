      <description>I want to share with you yet another tool this one will help you with the architecture development. The tool is called Structure 101and you can download a trial version here. That&amp;rsquo;s right, this tool is not free, but it does it&amp;rsquo;s job really well and at the time I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a free alternative that would be just as good. If you do know any good alternative, please, do leave a comment.</description>
