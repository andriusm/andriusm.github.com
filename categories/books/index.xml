      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how quickly technical books go out of date or sometimes just can keep up with the new versions of software constantly being released. I do like holding in my hands a nice printed book and enjoying the process of reading it, but for IT books it&amp;rsquo;s just a whole different story. You don&amp;rsquo;t usually need to read the entire book cover-to-cover, most often these books are used as references to help solve a specific problem.</description>
