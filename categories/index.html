      Another day – another lesson learned. Today I tried to optimize Apache HTTP server configuration in a sense to write less configuration to achieve the same result. Of course I messed up the first few times since I&rsquo;m not really an admin and don&rsquo;t have that much experience doing that. Typically relying on short configuration samples and snippets does the trick, but it&rsquo;s not always the best way to do things.

      This is yet another post on Apache httpd server installation and configuration. I say another because I&rsquo;ve already written about how to install the packaged version of Apachefor two specific linux distros. This time I&rsquo;ll quickly jot down how I configured and compiled Apache for my needs. There are a few reasons to do this. One of the more important ones being to have a newer version of Apache. It seems that prepackaged Apache versions for some linux distributions can be quite out of date.

      The Environment From time to time I need to do some Apache httpd + Tomcat installations on Linux servers and usually they come in different flavors. While you&rsquo;re still experimenting it&rsquo;s a good idea to use a pre-installed Linux on a virtual machine. I&rsquo;m using the free VMware playerto run virtual appliances, a list of which can be found on VMware page. Personally I like the clean Linux installations without any extras, this way you can install anything you need and create multiple virtual machines of the same Linux flavor with different purposes if you need to.

      Recently I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how quickly technical books go out of date or sometimes just can keep up with the new versions of software constantly being released. I do like holding in my hands a nice printed book and enjoying the process of reading it, but for IT books it&rsquo;s just a whole different story. You don&rsquo;t usually need to read the entire book cover-to-cover, most often these books are used as references to help solve a specific problem.

      All modern browsers nowadays have integrated development tools among which there&rsquo;s a JavaScript console where you can type in some JavaScript and test your ideas, debug your code or see output from your script&rsquo;s previous events. But the console is capable of so much more. Well, actually IE&rsquo;s console is somewhat more limited than others, but the rest of them are pretty cool. To get an idea of the possibilities visit the chrome developer tips and tricks page to learn more.

      From time to time I like checking out the bleeding edge version of some software. Firefox is always a good candidate for that, because of the many improvements in performance and features. I downloaded the Firefox 3.7a nightly build from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/. It&rsquo;s seems pretty stable on my computer and is obviously faster. Sunspidertests confirm my expectations of increased javascript performance which is roughly 40% faster than Firefox 3.5.5 on my machine.

Go to C:\Documents and Settings\User\Application Data\Apple Computer\Safari\Preferences\

For now I&rsquo;ll just share a little something I created for myself to help with the SSH tunnels that I need to create on a seemingly regular basis. Sometimes I forget or mix up the parameters that need to be passed to SSH client, especially when interconnecting these tunnels. In this simple tool you can enter the missing info to form a logical sentence in English language and when you click the generate button you get a command line for the SSH client.

      <p>After writing about keyboard oriented software I&rsquo;ve been doing a little experiment for a few weeks now and I thought I&rsquo;d share the results. I&rsquo;ve been using a little program called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Click Counter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, well actually it&rsquo;s a compiled AutoHotKey script which I found on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this forum<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Source for the script is available if you don&rsquo;t like the idea of using an executable found on some forum. My idea was to track all my mouse clicks throughout the day and see how much I can reduce the amount of times I reach for the roddent. The Click Counter tool only produces data as a text file, but it&rsquo;s way more fun to see some graphical representation of my clicking habits, so I threw together a <a href="http://andrius.miasnikovas.lt/files/clickchart.zip">simple Java program</a> that reads the produced log file from the Click Counter and outputs a nice graph with monthly mean average. It&rsquo;s done with maven and contains .bat files to further simplify the building and running process. So without further ado here are my results</p>

Sure there are all sorts of tools for server monitoring and performance tracking, but I found that most of the time you just need to know if the server is up &amp; running. And of course you should be notified if it&rsquo;s not.

      A couple of months ago I&rsquo;ve switched from Java development to developing for Mac OS X. Let me tell you, it&rsquo;s a completely different world, but that was to be expected. The first thing is to get acquainted with the OS and it&rsquo;s features. That actually didn&rsquo;t take too long. I&rsquo;m really pleased with the availability of a full-fledged UNIX console in the OS, so I&rsquo;m able to leverage all of my linux knowledge.

Another thing that immediately strikes you is that Maven became more strict.

This should be run from a parent POM&rsquo;s directory. It lets you view the POM file that would be in effect if you were building the project. The result is a composite POM containing all your child POMs that you defined as modules in the parent POM.

      Hi there! Here&rsquo;s another quick suggestion for all of you out there who have to deal with a lot of web server environments and need to make sure that they&rsquo;re all alive and responsive. Sure there are all sorts of tools for server monitoring and performance tracking, but I found that most of the time you just need to know if the server is up &amp; running. And of course you should be notified if it&rsquo;s not.

      I&rsquo;ll keep this one short. Don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;ve always been frustrated about how most FTP clients won&rsquo;t let you search for files on a remote FTP server. I remember I used some client that had this functionality, but this was quite a while ago so I can&rsquo;t even remember the name of it. If someone else knows any lightweight tools that let you do that, please leave a comment.

If you&rsquo;re a Python developer chances are you already know of it, but I use Python only from time to time, usually to automate some tasks so I was very excited to come across such a library. First thing&rsquo;s first, download PILand install it. I&rsquo;m using it on a Windows platform so I used the packaged binary version, but you can get the source code and use it on any platform that supports Python.

If you&rsquo;re running Windows and are using PuTTY to manage your unix servers, chances are you have a lot of saved sessions i.e. information on how to connect to your server, what font type and size to use, etc. And if you ever tried copying them to another machine you noticed that PuTTY doesn&rsquo;t have a user-friendly export/import sessions button. But there&rsquo;s a way to perform a saved sessions export manually.

But at times you have modify templates written by others and that&rsquo;s when you need to do some exploring like finding out what variables are actually passed to the template. This is not always easily found in code, sometimes it&rsquo;s simpler to print this stuff out when you&rsquo;re already in the template.

      Recently I needed to do some server manipulation over the SSH-2 protocol from a Java client program. There are quite a few choices of SSH libraries for Javaout there. Usually I prefer BSD license whenever possible, so I thought I&rsquo;ll give Ganymed SSH-2 for Javaa try. It turned out to be pretty simple to use. Here&rsquo;s a short example of how to connect to the server using the private key and execute some command.

      The Environment From time to time I need to do some Apache httpd + Tomcat installations on Linux servers and usually they come in different flavors. While you&rsquo;re still experimenting it&rsquo;s a good idea to use a pre-installed Linux on a virtual machine. I&rsquo;m using the free VMware playerto run virtual appliances, a list of which can be found on VMware page. Personally I like the clean Linux installations without any extras, this way you can install anything you need and create multiple virtual machines of the same Linux flavor with different purposes if you need to.

Sometimes I forget or mix up the parameters that need to be passed to SSH client, especially when interconnecting these tunnels. In this simple tool you can enter the missing info to form a logical sentence in English language and when you click the generate button you get a command line for the SSH client.

      Hi there! Here&rsquo;s another quick suggestion for all of you out there who have to deal with a lot of web server environments and need to make sure that they&rsquo;re all alive and responsive. Sure there are all sorts of tools for server monitoring and performance tracking, but I found that most of the time you just need to know if the server is up &amp; running. And of course you should be notified if it&rsquo;s not.

      I&rsquo;ll keep this one short. Don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;ve always been frustrated about how most FTP clients won&rsquo;t let you search for files on a remote FTP server. I remember I used some client that had this functionality, but this was quite a while ago so I can&rsquo;t even remember the name of it. If someone else knows any lightweight tools that let you do that, please leave a comment.

One tool that I&rsquo;ve been using for a while now is Process Explorerby Mark Russinovich who created many great tools to the Windows platform.

After choosing and installing an application launcher mentioned in my previous postthe next thing I wanted to do is automate a few tasks that I do several times a day. Each one takes a while and throughout the day this adds up. The worst thing is that sometimes another person distracts you from what you were doing and then it takes a while to get back into it.

      When dealing with source code from projects of various sizes the disk quickly gets filled up with literally tens or even hundreds of thousands of files. Especially when the project is under source control and has metadata files for each of the project&rsquo;s file. While you may still have a lot of disk space left on the drive I found that this kind of setup is highly inefficient when jumping from file to file in an IDE or doing a full text search.

But the really nice thing is that now they have this program called Update Cheker which you can download and install on you machine and it will analyze the software that you have installed and present you with a list of possible updates including the beta versions as a separate section.

The first thing is to get acquainted with the OS and it&rsquo;s features. That actually didn&rsquo;t take too long. I&rsquo;m really pleased with the availability of a full-fledged UNIX console in the OS, so I&rsquo;m able to leverage all of my linux knowledge.
