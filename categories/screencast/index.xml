      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in quite a while. Been busy with all the job switching, getting used to Mac things and such. On another topic while cleaning up my hard drive I&amp;rsquo;m finding various neat stuff, that I forgot about. Will try and share some of it with the rest of you. These are mostly things that you either need or don&amp;rsquo;t care about at all. One of those things is a screencast that I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten I made.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching quite a few screencasts which seem to be a really fun way to learn something. This made me want to create something of my own. So for this blog post I&amp;rsquo;m putting up my first attempts at creating screencasts while trying to explain something useful.
When dealing with PKI based application security, one usually encounters different systems on different platforms and making sure they can interact with each other can be quite a hassle.</description>
