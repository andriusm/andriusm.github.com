      <description>This post is a continuation on my quest for applications that help me do more by doing less. After choosing and installing an application launcher mentioned in my previous postthe next thing I wanted to do is automate a few tasks that I do several times a day. Each one takes a while and throughout the day this adds up. The worst thing is that sometimes another person distracts you from what you were doing and then it takes a while to get back intoÂ it.</description>
